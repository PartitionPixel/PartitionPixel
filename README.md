### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Partition Pixel and I'm a big fan of cryptocurrencies, NAS/Servers, Unraid, 3D Printing, programming, etc...

I'm trying to be more active in the communities of my passions. One of my goal is to start giving back to these communities and hopefully someday be a big part of them !

### Donations

If my work has impacted your life in a positive way and you'd like to buy me a coffee (or a hundred), that'd be much appreciated!
